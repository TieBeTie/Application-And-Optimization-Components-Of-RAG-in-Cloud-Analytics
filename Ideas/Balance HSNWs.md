Can we balance the length of the RAG relationships? In LeanRAG there are 3 levels of hierarchy, they fixed, but what if there is more effective way to define the right number of levels? 

For example, LLM can be not only summarize the entities and relationships between levels but also regulate the count of entities in levels? What if there is an optimal count of them?
