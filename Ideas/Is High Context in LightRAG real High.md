I investigated a LightRAG article and discovered that entities produced by vector similarity are defined as low-level context (lexical). I agree with that, but what about High Context (semantical)? 

There is a statement that the set of neighbor relationships and entities of the entities founded by vector similarity define the semantic context. Maybe that's effective, but obviously not all of them are really needed. 

How can they be pruned? Perhaps, with the help of LLM, or we need to define something else during the construction of RAG.
